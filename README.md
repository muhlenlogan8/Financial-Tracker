# Financial Tracker


### Reworking as of 11/12/24 to align with xlsx from my bank to ease process of getting transaction data

An R Shiny application that helps users track, analyze, and visualize their financial data.

## Vision
I started this project so I can have a customizable application that visualizes and analyzes my financial data. Along with this, I want to ensure I maintain the skills I learned at my last internship where I developed an application in R.

## Current State
The application currently is my first attempt at a financial tracker dashboard. I intend to build off this current state by adding more financial analysis aspects, visualizations, and other user options. I also want to experiment with a home page the user is directed to initially where they can log in or input their financial data before accessing the dashboard.

## Plan
An initial page that prompts the user for either a login or to upload a .xlsx file of financial data.

From here the user will go to their financial dashboard where they can find metrics, visuals, and other features.
Example visualization:

## Next Steps
I will begin by creating the initial page that is shown to the user and ensure I can show this page and then take the user to the dashboard page since this is a new concept to me. After this, I plan to build out the dashboard by adding visualizations and specialized tabs. Along with this, I will continue thinking of different visuals, metrics, or calculations that may be useful to incorporate into the app. In the long term, I'd love to find a way to not only have the app show your financial data but make suggestions based on it as well and possibly even identify reoccurring payments the user is making based on their inputted data.
